\emph{
    I seize this opportunity to express gratitude to my advisor, professor Luigi
    Palopoli, for sharing his ideas and expertise in real-time systems.
    My sincere thanks go also to my co-advisor Nicola Manica, who strongly
    supported me throughout the entire work of this thesis.\\
    Most importantly, this would not have been feasible without the help
    of my family. Last but not least, I want thank my girlfriend Valentina
    and all my friends for their essential contribute.
